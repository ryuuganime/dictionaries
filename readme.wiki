= File information =

We use plain text format (<code>.txt</code> and <a href="#About_rydict"><code>.rydict</code></a>) for dictionaries, and MediaWiki file format (<code>.wiki</code>) for README and some important information.

== About .rydict ==

<code>.rydict</code> (stand for <u>Ry</u>uuganime <u>Dict</u>ionary) is a self-curated wordlist collected from several sources and implement into one file by Ryuuganime itself using plain text format (<code>.txt</code>). Basically helps dictionary/spelling checker extension/app from overhaul by the resources, so it can reduce a lot of memory consumed by the app/extension.
